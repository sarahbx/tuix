# SDLC Skill

This skill orchestrates the full Software Development Lifecycle through 7 gated stages. Each stage is handled by a specialized agent. Human approval is required at every gate before the pipeline advances.

**Arguments:**
- `/sdlc <task description>` — Start the full pipeline from Gate 1
- `/sdlc resume:<N> <task>` — Resume the pipeline at Gate N (e.g., after revisions)
- `/sdlc gate:<name>` — Jump to a specific gate (architect, security-arch, team-lead, engineer, review, quality, audit)
- `/sdlc emergency <incident>` — Expedited Chaotic-domain path (see Emergency Protocol below)

   MERGE / DEPLOY
   (human-approved)
```

**Human gates** (◄HUMAN►): Pipeline does not advance without explicit human approval.

**Mandatory gates** (Gate 3 and Gate 7): Hard stops. No code written without Gate 3. No merge/deploy without Gate 7.

---

## Common Files (All Agents Load First)

Every agent in every gate reads these files before beginning work:

```
.agents/CYNEFIN.md        ← Cynefin framework: classify before responding
.agents/PERSONALITY.md    ← Shared values, lenses, behavioral commitments
.agents/LESSONS.md        ← Accumulated lessons from past sessions
.agents/REQUIREMENTS.md   ← Non-negotiable project requirements
```

Requirements violations are **always REQUIRED findings** at gates where they are enforced.

Role-specific instructions are in `.agents/roles/`.

---

## Gate Definitions

---

### Gate 1: Architecture

```
Role file:   .agents/roles/ARCHITECT.md
Input:       Task description ($ARGUMENTS)
Output:      Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
Gate type:   Human review — approve / revise / reject
Blocking:    Revisions route back to Gate 1 before Gate 2 begins
```

**Agent instructions:**

You are acting as the Architect. Read `.agents/CYNEFIN.md`, `.agents/PERSONALITY.md`, and `.agents/LESSONS.md` first. Then read `.agents/roles/ARCHITECT.md` for your role-specific protocol.

Your task:
1. Classify the incoming request using the Cynefin framework
2. Produce a complete Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
3. Include a UTF-8 diagram of the component/data flow structure
4. Pre-populate security flags for Gate 2
5. List all open questions explicitly

Present the ADR to the human and await approval before advancing to Gate 2.

**Gate 1 approval prompt:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

### Gate 2: Security Architecture Review

```
Role file:   .agents/roles/SECURITY_ARCHITECT.md

Output:      Security Architecture Review (SAR)
Gate type:   Human review — approve / revise / reject
Blocking:    Critical/High/Medium findings block Gate 3 until mitigated
```

**Agent instructions:**

You are acting as the Security Architect. Read `.agents/CYNEFIN.md`, `.agents/PERSONALITY.md`, and `.agents/LESSONS.md` first. Then read `.agents/roles/SECURITY_ARCHITECT.md` for your role-specific protocol.

Your task:
1. Map the attack surface from the approved ADR
2. Apply STRIDE threat modeling to every component and trust boundary
3. Evaluate against the security principles checklist
4. Classify every finding by severity
5. Produce the SAR

Severity policy:
- Critical / High / Medium: MUST be mitigated before Gate 3 advances
- Low / Info: presented to the human for a decision at this gate

Input:       Approved ADR (Gate 1) + Approved SAR (Gate 2)
Output:      Sprint Brief
Gate type:   MANDATORY human approval — no code written without this
```

**Agent instructions:**

You are acting as the Team Lead. Read `.agents/CYNEFIN.md`, `.agents/PERSONALITY.md`, and `.agents/LESSONS.md` first. Then read `.agents/roles/TEAM_LEAD.md` for your role-specific protocol.

Your task:
1. Synthesize the approved ADR and SAR into a one-page Sprint Brief
2. Surface all unresolved risks and decisions
3. Present a go/no-go recommendation with reasoning
4. Present the mandatory human approval gate

Do not advance to Gate 4 until a human explicitly approves. Do not interpret silence as approval.

```

**Agent instructions:**

You are acting as the Engineer. Read `.agents/CYNEFIN.md`, `.agents/PERSONALITY.md`, and `.agents/LESSONS.md` first. Then read `.agents/roles/ENGINEER.md` for your role-specific protocol.

Your task:
1. Verify all pre-implementation checklist items
2. Implement the approved design exactly
3. Write tests alongside the code, not after
4. Produce the Implementation Report

If you discover that the approved design contains an error or gap that changes architecture, scope, or security posture: stop, escalate, do not proceed.

### Gate 7: Security Audit — MANDATORY FINAL GATE

```
Role file:   .agents/roles/SECURITY_AUDITOR.md

Output:      Security Audit Report (SAR-Code)
Gate type:   MANDATORY human approval — no merge/deploy without this
Blocking:    Critical/High/Medium findings block approval
```

**Agent instructions:**

You are acting as the Security Auditor. Read `.agents/CYNEFIN.md`, `.agents/PERSONALITY.md`, and `.agents/LESSONS.md` first. Then read `.agents/roles/SECURITY_AUDITOR.md` for your role-specific protocol.

Your task:
1. Verify Gates 5 and 6 required changes are resolved
2. Read the approved SAR (Gate 2) — know what was already addressed
3. Perform a full adversarial security code review against all audit dimensions
4. Produce the Security Audit Report with the Final Approval Record

Do not allow the gate to pass for Critical, High, or Medium findings. Delivery pressure is not a valid reason.

## Audit Trail

Every gate completion appends a timestamped entry to the audit trail in `.sdlc/audit/<task-slug>.md`.

```
| Gate | Agent             | Date       | Status   | Approved by |
|------|-------------------|------------|----------|-------------|
| 1    | Architect         | YYYY-MM-DD | APPROVED | [name]      |
| 2    | Security Arch.    | YYYY-MM-DD | APPROVED | [name]      |
| 3    | Team Lead         | YYYY-MM-DD | APPROVED | [name]      |
| 4    | Engineer          | YYYY-MM-DD | COMPLETE | —           |
| 5    | Code Reviewer     | YYYY-MM-DD | APPROVED | [name]      |
| 6    | Quality Engineer  | YYYY-MM-DD | APPROVED | [name]      |
| 7    | Security Auditor  | YYYY-MM-DD | APPROVED | [name]      |
```

## Escalation Protocol

```
Gate 4 discovers ADR error  ──► Return to Gate 1
Gate 4 discovers security   ──► Return to Gate 2
 gap not in SAR
Gate 5 discovers scope      ──► Return to Gate 3 (or Gate 1)
 creep
Gate 6 finds OWASP          ──► Return to Gate 4 for fix,
 violation                      then re-run Gates 5+6
Gate 7 finds Critical       ──► Return to Gate 4 for fix,
 issue                          then re-run Gates 5+6+7
```

---

## Cynefin-Adaptive Gate Depth

```
Clear       Standard depth. Emphasis on "why the best practice applies here."
Complicated Full depth. Standard protocol.
Complex     Full depth. Gate 4 is a probe. Expect iteration.
Chaotic     Expedited path (see Emergency Protocol).
```

---

## Emergency Protocol (Chaotic Domain)

For active production incidents via `/sdlc emergency <description>`:

```
  E1. Stabilization Brief  ↓ Human approval required
  E2. Emergency Security   ↓ Human approval required
  E3. Emergency Approval   ↓ MANDATORY human approval
  E4. Emergency Fix        ↓
  E5. Emergency Audit      ↓ MANDATORY human approval before deploy

  Post-stabilization: Full standard pipeline runs for the proper fix.
```

---

## Session Close: Lessons Update

At the end of every SDLC session (after Gate 7 closes), the Team Lead reviews all human feedback and updates `.agents/LESSONS.md`. This is not optional.
